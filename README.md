# Projects 2024-2025  

This repository includes some of the projects I worked on during 2024 and 2025, covering data visualization, process automation, and analysis using Python.  

## 📊 Data Visualization 
During 2024, I worked with **Power BI** to create reports and dashboards within my work environment. Although the data used is not public, I have included some reference images with non-sensitive information in the `BI` folder.  

## 🐍 Data Extraction and Analysis with Python  
I developed **Python** scripts to extract data through **web scraping**, specifically from **Ciudadano Digital** (a government platform). Since the original tables are not available, but the data can be accessed, I use scraping to capture and store it in a database for analysis.  

## ⚙️ Automation with PowerApps and Power Automate  
I implemented workflows using **PowerApps** and **Power Automate** for an application used by over **40 inspectors** in the generation of reports. The repository includes details about its functionality.  

## 📚 Presentation in International Economics  
I used **Python** to prepare analyses and visualizations as part of a presentation at the university on **International Economics**.

This repository includes reference materials and documentation for the projects.
